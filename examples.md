# Examples

Here you will find short examples of engineering character sheets for different scenarios. These are not exhaustive to 
any job, where you want to have a mix of skills from every category. Instead, these are highlights of necessary vs
unnecessary skills.

## The Small Scale Communicator

### Scenario

I need to quickly build internal tools to help the Customer Service team.

### Character

You need someone skilled in building small projects quickly, but not necessarily beautiful or at scale. 
They also need to be able to communicate well directly with their stakeholders since they are internal team members.

Level 2/3 on programming skills, with level 4/5 on external team collaboration.

## The Scaling Architect

### Scenario

I made a POC and now need to create a real system to deal with a million users.

### Character

You need someone who has shipped complex systems at scale. They don't need to be able code everything,
instead be highly attuned to your customer and the actions they are likely to take at bulk.

Level 4/5 on system design and collaboration, level 1/2 on programming language specifics.

## The Compliance Tester

### Scenario

I am in a high risk industry (banking, healthcare) and I need to upgrade a legacy system without getting sued.

### Character

You need someone that understands the unique compliance demands of your industry. They do not need to create flashy, 
latest technology products. They need to be empathetic to stakeholders and users, but their number one goal is keep 
products running safely. Fail fast is not an option.  They need to test methodically to avoid catastrophic failure.

Level 4/5 on industry knowledge, testing and tackling difficult tasks with unknowns. Level 2/3 on programming 
language (especially if legacy code is in an unpopular language).

## The Problem Solving Listener

### Scenario

I want to automate manual administrative processes for enterprise customers.

### Character

You need someone who can look past the complaint to the actual problem. They can discern between technical and educational
problems. Industry experience is helpful to already know common workflows, culture and pitfalls. They do not have to be 
an expert in system design or scale when they will be solving some problems with scripts, webhooks and spreadsheets.

Level 4/5 on problem solving, collaboration and empathy. Level 2/3 on industry knowledge. Level 1/2 on system design.
